Welcome to Japsa's documentation!

Japsa (*JAva Package for Sequence Analysis*) is a free, open source package for
analysis of biological sequences data, written in Java. It contains a wide
range of analysis tools that biologists and bioinformaticians would routinely
use but may not be available elsewhere. It also provides a Java library to be
incorporated in other Java projects.

The package aims to be lightweight (fast and memory efficient) and to use the
least possible dependencies. Its tools have a consistent command line interface
and support reading from/writing to streams whenever possible.

Japsa's source code is licensed under the BSD license and is available on
`GitHub <https://github.com/mdcao/japsa/>`_.
